- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affectes your programming

I feel like association makes everything flow better, I think its cool how everything was made seperatly then brought together. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I would advise going to TA hours even if you have the most minor question. I found it is helpful to code around other people doing the same thing and haveing a TA to ask if you get stuck.
